# supermarketsales
The dataset used in this project was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales). It contains several information about the customer (member type and gender), the product (category, unit price, quantity bought, total price after tax), gross maring and income and customer overall rating experience.
The script was made for SSMS use so due changes must be made for other SQL types.
